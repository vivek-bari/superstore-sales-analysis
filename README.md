# superstore-sales-analysis

This project analyzes U.S. Superstore sales data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to extract key business insights. The notebook covers data cleaning (e.g., imputing missing values), year-wise sales trends (2010â€“2013), regional profitability, product-wise margins, and shipping mode distribution. Key findings include California being the top revenue state (20.8% share), Technology as the most profitable category (~$680K), and Regular Air accounting for 74.6% of shipments. Visualizations and statistical analysis support strategic decision-making in sales, logistics, and marketing.
